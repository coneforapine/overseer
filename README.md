# Overseer

I'm trying to learn the Rust programming language for the sake of relaxing myself and I had no idea what to do.

I said to myself. 

There it is. The overseer, last bot I'm making for myself *plus some friends*.

# Planned commands

I keep a kanban on [notion](https://www.notion.so/coneforapine/9bf45b3cf2c1412d8ff48a3766e7b12d?v=46a6dddcc0ba4d12b5e833a6c6e9d5e9). You can track the planned stuff here.

If you want a command to be added, you can always open an issue. Perhaps a pull request since I'm a bit rusty for the Rust programming. (pun definetly intended hehe)

# Why I don't use diesel to generate migrations and write all the sql myself.

It's a simple answer. I've used many orms in many languages and I kinda forgot writing sql queries myself.

I aim to learn SQL by using sqlx library for simple database stuff.
